# s21_decimal 

Long arithmetic in C. Addition, subtraction, division, multiplication + other helper functions. Most funcs are based on bitwise operations.
**The structure to store numbers (16 byte array) is hardly applicable to any other projects** and will not allow to test the code from scratch.

Tests provided in `src\test` can be used to assess the output of functions compared to GMP lib code (gmp.h should be installed locally on your PC).
